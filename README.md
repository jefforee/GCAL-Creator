# GCAL Creator

GCAL Creator is a Google Chrome extension designed to streamline the creation of Google Calendar events by transforming user text input into dynamically generated and compelling event descriptions.

## Features
Text-to-Event Conversion: Implemented a Chrome extension that seamlessly translates user text input into Google Calendar events.

OpenAI GPT-4.0 Integration: Leveraged the power of OpenAI's GPT-4.0 model to parse natural language given by text inputs and generate formatted responses for event creation.

Google Calendar API: Utilizes Google Cloud for API keys and OAuth 2.0 Client IDs to authorize extending access to users' Google Calendar. Then, it uses Google Calendar API to link to an Event Creation interface. 

Simplified Workflow: Designed with a user-friendly interface to simplify the process of creating engaging event descriptions and seamlessly integrating them with Google Calendar. All that is required is a text input from the user to generate an event
